S.S. Jain Subodh Shiksha Samiti has stood the test of time and has been recorded as the trailblazer in the field of education. A century ago, it was inconceivable to bring youth of diverse cultural backgrounds under one roof to impart higher education based on moral values. The founders of Subodh visualized an educational set-up and transformed spirited vision into reality. It has been acknowledged as a leading centre for approach so that the students evolve as leaders and transforming agents who make a significant contribution in all spheres of life.<br><br>
Since the year 1918, the Samiti is a forerunner in the field of education in Rajasthan. It is a Not-For- Profit society working with a missionary zeal, providing selfless service to the people at large.<br> <br> The legacy of dedication is matchless as it has extended its boundaries by establishing seventeen institutions which are successfully running under its umbrella, ranging from school to postgraduate colleges, teachers' training college as well as reputed and well known professional institutions like MBA MCA college and Law college.</b>
